This project involved creating a four-function calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also added decimal, percentage, and sign change buttons. Because this is a JavaScript exercise, I used minimal CSS.

Note: due to Git errors, previous versions were lost. This version was originally uploaded on February 16th.

FURTHER CHANGES
1. Repeating decimal bug - incorporate a maximum length for the main display
2. Expand CSS
3. More buttons/functions?
